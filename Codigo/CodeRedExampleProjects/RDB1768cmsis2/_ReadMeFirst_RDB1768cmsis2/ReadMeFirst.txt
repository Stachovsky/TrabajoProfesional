_ReadMeFirst_RDB1768cmsis2
==========================
The RDB1768cmsis2 zip file contains a set of example projects
suitable for use on Code Red's RDB1768 development board.

Many of the examples would also form a useful starting point
for developments for other LPC17xx based systems. The main
board specific code used by the examples is for the LCD,
though you will need to check the pin configurations used
for other peripherals too.

The examples all link with the CMSIS 2.0 library, 
CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx, hence the "2" in their filenames 
(RDB1768cmsis2...) to distinguish them from previous RDB1768
examples which linked against the earlier CMSIS 1.3 library.

For details of the indidual examples, please see the readme.txt
file contained within each project.

Note that these example projects are intended for use with 
Red Suite / LPCXpresso IDE v4.0 or later. Use of these projects
with earlier versions of the Code Red IDE is not recommended or
supported.
