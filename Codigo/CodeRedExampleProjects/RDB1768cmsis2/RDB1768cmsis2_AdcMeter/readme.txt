Code Red Technologies RDB1768 Board - ADC Meter Demo
====================================================

[ Note that this project requires the CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx library 
  project as well as the LCDLib project to exist in the same 
  workspace. ]
  
This demonstration project show how the potentiometer on the
RDB1768 can be read using the analogue to digital convertor
built in the the LPC1768 microcontroller.

It also makes use of the LCD screen to display the ADC value
read, both in integer form and as a bar meter.

To change the value, simply rotate the potentiometer.
